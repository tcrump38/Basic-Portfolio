        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I am an eager and intrepid learner. I have been dabbling and cultivating coding and web development skills for a time now. I started an elemental Wordpress blog for health and dieting but am sinking my teeth deeper into the nuts and bolts of programming on the web. I am a graduate of Texas Tech University and have made Austin my home now for almost 3 years. My background is in sales and trading, specifically freight-brokering. My family and I have set roots in Austin and have taken full advantage of the many bike trails through out the city. My Brittany Spaniel, Graham, has taken full advantage of the amazing dog parks that can be found. We love it here and I plan on improving the experience with a career change into web development!</p>
